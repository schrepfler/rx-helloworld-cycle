Rx Betslip
====

Rationale
----

The Rx Betlip is intended to be a tested and reusable [Web Component] following the latest web standard and aspiring to
provide a stable and maintainable UI Javascript component used to build and place betslips.

Development
----

The rx-betslip.html [src/rx-betslip.html] is the main point of entry to your component. Its segmented in three sections:
* style
* template
* script
Once they get filled, the bosonic transpiler will take the code from the given sections and generate rx-betslip.css and
rx-betslip.js.


The rx-betslip web component builds on top of the [Bosonic] toolset.
